                            For the past three years, besides my coursework in the BS of Computer Science program 
                            at <a href="https://spu.edu/" target="_blank">Seattle Pacific University,</a> I have worked 
                            with professionals from different expertise 
                            on various projects ranging from a simple RESTful API service to a full-fledged 
                            cross-platform mobile application. I have experience working in all phases of software 
                            development from planning and research, and systems design, to implementation and deployment.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Besides the technical knowledge, I have management and customer-service experience. 
                            From the multiple managerial positions, I have learned to train, motivate, and direct 
                            co-workers to optimize productivity and promote growth while ensuring customer 
                            satisfaction.

                            professionally and explore options within the tech industry. I would like to use my 
                            experience to develop quality software products that meet user needs.

                        I have always enjoyed learning. Growing up, I didn't have much access to resources. 
                        And realizing that opportunities don't come by easily, I would always try to get the 
                        most out of learning opportunities. And soon after that, I fell in love with the 
                        learning process. Even today I continue to pick up new skills here and there, whether 
                        it is a soccer move or a new programming language.

                        From top of the World to the streets of Seattle.

                        <p>
                            I was born and raised in the remote Himalayas near Mt. Everest. Since a very young age, 
                            the region’s interaction with tourists from all across the Globe allowed me to observe 
                            how technology has transformed lives all around the World. And as I grew older, my 
                            interest in Technology and the desire to explore this field of Science only grew stronger. 
                            I could see how it would make so much difference in people's lives in my area, but the 
                            inability to make that happen pushed me to take on a journey that I could hardly believe 
                            was possible. I moved to the city at a very young age with hopes of getting foundational 
                            tech education but with tech infrastructure in Nepal still developing at the time, 
                            I wasn’t able to gain much. The inability to learn and explore pushed me even more 
                            and I decided to move to the United States.  </p>
                            
                            <p>
                            After four years of hard work and determination, 
                            I have completed my CS degree. And while this is a big achievement for me and my family, 
                            I am even more focused to aim higher and work towards a successful career. In the coming days, 
                            I am looking to explore the tech industry and get to grow alongside professionals. 
                            With COVID and everything that has been going around, it has been challenging which 
                            means I need to push even harder.

                                <strong>Left Home for the 1st time:</strong> After finishing 8th grade at the age of 12, I had to move to the city to continue my education since there
                                were no local high-schools in the mountains.

                                <strong>First Programming Experince:</strong> After moving to the city, I was able to enroll in my very first CS class.
                                 My very first coding experince was writing Qbasic codes in paper. Our high-school had about 10 computers and we would harldy get about
                                15 mins to use it in a month. We still got the most out of it and I really enjoyed it.

                                <strong>Moved to USA:</strong> After movving to the city, I had imagined that I could acomplish anything that I had dreamed of. But it wasn't long
                                until I realized that Tech Education in Nepal still had a long way to go. After some considerations, I decided to move to the US for my
                                undergraduate studies.

                                <strong> Graduation: </strong> After some hurdles and four years of grinding, I graduated from Seattle Pacific University with a BS degree in Computer Science. I am
                                excited to see where life will take me next.
